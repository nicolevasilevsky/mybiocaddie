# Tracking this repo

The repo at biodatasets/mybiocaddie is designed to be forked and customized.

Occasionally there will be source changes in HTML layout etc. You can track these as follows.

First do a one time command in your forked repo, once cloned:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:biodatasets/mybiocaddie
```

Then any time you want to bring in the latest:

```
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/gh-pages
```

It is probably best if you do NOT try anything in the reverse direction. If you want to see changes file a ticket directly on biodatasets/mybiocaddie
